# ${display_name}

A Pebble Alloy project — embedded JavaScript on the watch, powered by Moddable
XS, alongside C.

## Building & running

```sh
pebble build                          # build for all targetPlatforms
pebble install --emulator emery       # install on the emery emulator
pebble install --phone <ip>           # install to a paired phone
```

## Target platforms

Alloy targets the modern Pebble hardware: **emery** (Pebble Time 2) and
**gabbro** (Pebble Round 2). Other platforms are currently not supported.
